ArrayGenerator Class

A constructor that accepts 3 parameters,
1) the size of the array
2) the lowest possible value in the array (inclusive)
3) the highest possible value (inclusive)
Then builds and saves the specified instance array of integers.

A method named getArray() which will
return a reference of the instance array to the client.

A method named ascendingSort() which will sort the instance Array
in ascending order.

A method named descendingSort() which will sort the instance Array
in descending order.

*************************************************************************
Do not modify the source code in SorterGUI or SorterMain

You must demonstrate the use of the insertion sort and selection sort
 algorithms using only java arrays NOT ArrayLists:.
 
 You may return to Lesson 7_5, copy and re-tool your ArrayList sorts 
 to work with arrays. One of them must be modified into a descending sort.
